Hackathon Project for HUMANS Lab

Sentiment Analysis on ùïè (formerly known as Twitter) Data (U.S. 2024 Election)

This project explores whether sentiment analysis of Twitter data can effectively capture voter sentiment during elections by comparing it to traditional polling methods. By using NLP tools, the analysis focuses on Twitter conversations surrounding key figures, events, and topics during the 2024 United States Election. The project examines how well sentiment analysis reflects voter attitudes and whether it provides insights that align with or diverge from traditional polling results, offering a new perspective on how to approach public discourse during elections. 

Ultimately, the project seeks to answer the question: Can sentiment analysis of Twitter data capture voter sentiment during elections compared to traditional polling methods?

hackathonproject.ipynb: contains preprocessing steps and implementation of a HuggingFace DistilBERT model pipeline on ùïè (Twitter) data.

tweets_with_sentiment_analysis.csv: displays a processed version of the data after it has been filtered and includes a sentiment label and confidence score.

Running this python notebook sequentially should provide exact outputs as seen in the research project results.
